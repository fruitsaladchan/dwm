# extra

- i am using [luke smiths st](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st) for my terminal
- if you want my bar move the dwmbar.sh in your ~/.local/bin/ and start it up with xinitrc
- to use pywal with dwm move the setbg script into your ~/.local/bin/ and use that to change wallpapers
- i am also using picom with this setup to get animations and blurred terminals. if you want to use my config move the picom.conf to ~/.config/picom/
